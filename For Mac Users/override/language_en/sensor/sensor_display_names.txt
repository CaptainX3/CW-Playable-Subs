wp_shark_tail=Shark Tail=This is a passive low-frequency towed array that equips all Soviet submarines of recent construction from the Victor III onwards. While not comparable to American towed array systems, it nevertheless provides the Soviets wih an improved sonar capability which earlier generations were lacking, giving these newer boats something of a quantum leap in capabilities and the threat they provide.
