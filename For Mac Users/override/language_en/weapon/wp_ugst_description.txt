WeaponDescriptiveName=UGST Torpedo
WeaponDescription=The UGST is a heavy deepwater torpedo with a range of up to 60 km (export versions are limited to 40 km). It differs from the most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or peroxide propulsion, it uses the Otto fuel axial engine, which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots.\nIt also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive wake homing, features a phased array active sonar and an improved wire guidance system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow propeller shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side.\nTogether with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before.
