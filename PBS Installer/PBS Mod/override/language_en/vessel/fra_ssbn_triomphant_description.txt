In French, the type is called Sous-marin Nucleaire Lanceur d'Engins Nouvelle Generation (SNLE-NG), literally "Next Generation Missile-launching nuclear submarine". Propelled by a pump-jet system, it is one of the most stealthy SSBNs in the world. The class entered active service in 1997 in replacement of the Le Redoutable class. Four Triomphant-class submarines are active in the French Navy, with one to two of them being on patrol at any given time.
