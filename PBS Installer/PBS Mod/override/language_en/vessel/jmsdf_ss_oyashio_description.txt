The submarines entered service in the late 1990s. The submarines are larger than the earlier Harushio Class, to provide space for a flank sonar array. There are a total of 11 boats in the class - the last boat was commissioned in 2008. Boats of this class carry the Type 59 torpedo and the Harpoon anti-ship missile.
