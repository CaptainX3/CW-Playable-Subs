History=Self Noise Rating: 125 db\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nThis is the latest and most advanced diesel-electric submarine built by the Soviets. Compared to earlier designs, the Kilo has adopted the Albacore-hull form, which makes it much faster underwater. It is also much quieter, and carries weapons and sensors on par with the third-generation nuclear attack submarines like the Victor III.
