# IMPORTANT MESSAGE - BEAT BUILD REQUIRED!

* The current version of the mod requires a Steam copy of the game and requires you to opt into the Beta build that includes the South China Sea campaign and all of the new units and weapons. The mod **will not** work without the Beta build. To opt into the Beta, open your Steam games list, right click on Cold Waters, and select "Properties". When the window opens, click the "Betas" tab and choose the beta build from the dropdown. You should see a large update download for the game. Once it finishes, you're ready to install the mod and play.

## Welcome to the New Playable Subs Mod

* This Github repository is the official development center for the New Playable Subs & More mod for Cold Waters. In this repository, we have two versions of the mod - the official stable release version and the development version.

* [Click here](https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/releases) to download the latest official, stable public release of the mod. This is the release that most users need to download. It will be updated periodically to reflect the latest major changes after they have been completed and are verified working.

* The development version of the mod is what you're seeing on the main page. **The development version of the mod is a constantly changing work in progress between mutiple developers, and is not guaranteed to be completely working or bug free. For most users, we recommend that you stick to the latest official release version linked above.** If you would like to try the latest development version of the mod, you can scroll down to the First Time Installation (Development Version) instructions below.

* If you have a bug report, the best place to let us know about it is to [open a new Issue](https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/issues) here on Github and we'll see it and respond. You can also let us know directly in the [official CW Discord](https://discord.gg/mMvpzSV), in the **pbs_mod** channel. This Discord is also a fast way to ask for tech support for the mod as well.

## Submitting Bug Reports, Suggestions, and Requests

* Everyone is welcome to use the Github Issues system to submit issues, bug reports, and suggestions. We have a system set up to handle and respond to these issues from our end.
* We are also open to requests for new submarines using the same Issue system. If you have a submarine you'd like to see in the mod, open up a new Issue and ask us!
* We have created a label system to tag all issues. All issues will initially be assigned a Category label, which will have a white background (except for bug reports, which will have a red background). Once the mod developers review an issue, they'll assign a Status label to it. This label indicates the current status of the issue and if any further comments are needed.
* Keep an eye on issues you submit, so you can respond to developer requests if needed. Issues that require further input but do not receive it within 7 days will be closed.

## Other Important Changes

* The Red Storm Rising (Free Roam) campaign has returned! This campaign is set up so that the player is tasked with a SEAL insertion mission with an extremely long timeframe (2400-3600 hours) to allow the player to roam the map and sink enemies as their leisure. Once the player is ready, they can insert the SEAL team at the designated location and trigger the final SSBN hunting mission. The time frame of this campaign has been changed to 2000 to allow for all of the older and modern Russian subs to be added as possible opponents.
* Player home base in SCS campaign changed to Okinawa, since it is a much more likely location for a US sub base in this theater of operations, and hopefully will somewhat ease the issue of automatically failing your mission whenever you need to rearm.
* Minimum aircraft distance to allow exiting a mission (NearbyAircraftMinDistance) changed from 10000 to 3500, so you're not stuck waiting forever for aircraft to disappear after you sink their mothership.
* Sonar signatures have been reworked. You will see the entire vessel list when playing single missions, but the campaign singature libraries have been left as they were in vanilla, since none of the new subs in this mod will appear in the campaigns.
* In this version of the mod, there is only ONE version of each sub instead of separate vanilla and playable versions like before. (This means that the playable Yasen you love will also be the Yasen you face in the campaigns and single missions.)

## Single Missions List Color Coding

* Single missions in the mod are color coded as follows:
  * White - Vanilla missions from Killerfish, modified to allow all playable subs to be used.
  * Orange - New missions sent to us by mod users, already designed with the mod's playable subs.
  * Green - These are custom missions that are unique in some way, usually featuring only certain playable subs and/or a unique objective.
  * Red - These are custom missions for the Red side (Russia, China, etc) (Note: All playable subs will be available for the player to choose from, but the enemies will be from the opposite side.)
  * Blue - These are custom missions for the Blue side (USA, UK, etc) (Note: All playable subs will be available for the player to choose from, but the enemies will be from the opposite side.)

## Mod Installation (Release Version)

* STEP 1: [Click here](https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/releases) to open the Releases page.

* STEP 2: Click on the **Source code (zip)** link to initiate the download. Save the ZIP file to your desktop or wherever you can access it easily.

* STEP 3: Double click on the ZIP file to open it. Inside you'll see a single folder called **CW-Playable-Subs** with the release date and version number. Click on this folder to open it.

* STEP 4: Now you'll see three files in the window - Readme.md, a **PBS Installer** folder, and a For Mac Users folder. You want to extract ONLY the **PBS Installer** folder to your desktop or wherever you can easily access it.

* STEP 5: Open the **PBS Installer** folder and double click on the **PBS_Installer.exe** file. The installer program should open.

* STEP 6: Follow the instructions in the Installer on each tab until you reach the Install/Uninstall tab.

* STEP 7: If you're using a Steam copy of Cold Waters and **did not change the default install directory,** click Install Mod and proceed to the next step. **If you're using the GOG games version of Cold Waters, or you changed the default install directory,** then choose the correct directory (wherever the ColdWaters.exe file is located) on this screen and then click Install Mod.

* STEP 8: You're done. Run the game and enjoy all of the new stuff!

## Mod Installation For Mac Users

***Special Note: Because the installer will not work on Mac OS and we currently do not have anyone who can make one for Mac, the Mac version of the mod automatically has ALL core and optional subs already installed. This is unavoidable for the time being, but at least makes the mod work for Mac users.***

* STEP 1: Click the green "Clone or Download" button that you see at the top of this page.

* STEP 2: Click the "Download ZIP" option.

* STEP 3: Double click on the ZIP file to open it. Inside you'll see a single folder called **CW-Playable-Subs-0-master-release**. Click on this folder to open it.

* STEP 4: Now you'll see three files in the window - Readme.md, a PBS Installer folder, and a **For Mac Users** folder. You want to extract ONLY the **For Mac Users** folder to wherever you can easily access it. Now double click to open the **For Mac Users** folder, and you'll see an **override** folder.

* STEP 5: Open this directory **Steam\SteamApps\common\Cold Waters\ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets** and drag the **override** folder into it. You should now see two folders here - **default** and **override**.

* STEP 6: You're done. Run the game and enjoy all of the new stuff!

---
## Updating The Mod

* To update the mod for **Windows**, simply follow the installation instructions for whichever version you're using above. The PBS Installer program will automatically uninstall the old version of the mod for you and install the latest version. **Make sure you choose the optional subs you want again, and pay close attention to the list, we may have added new options!**

* To update the mod for **Mac**, follow STEPS 1 thru 4 in the *Mod Installation For Mac Users** section above, and then navigate to **Steam\SteamApps\common\Cold Waters\ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets** and DELETE the existing **override** folder. Once you have deleted the old folder, you can then drag in the updated copy. DO NOT DRAG THE NEW COPY AND TRY TO OVERWRITE THE OLD ONE - you will end up with major bugs this way!

## How To Customize The UI Toolbars
The positions of the UI toolbars for helm, depth, and sensors can be customized via the HUD text files if you don't like how we have them by default. In order to change their positions, you want to open the "override" folder and then open the "hud" folder. In here, you want to open the 3 text files - default.txt, russian.txt, and uk.txt.

In the default.txt file, scroll down to Line 231 (or, alternatively, scroll down and look for [HUD LAYOUT] in the file, the code blocks are a bit below that). Starting at line 231, you'll see three blocks of code. Each block is a specific option for how the toolbars will be placed, each with a description above the block for what it does. Here is what the text blocks look like:

```
//Toolbar position 0,0, (1 to anchor to minimap or 0 for no anchor)
//Default toolbars overlap and enabled via tabs/keys
//ToolbarsPos=0,0,0
//ForceAllToolbarsOn=FALSE
//HelmToolbarOffset=0,0
//DiveToolbarOffset=0,0
//SensorToolbarOffset=0,0

//Force all toolbars on in bottom horizontal row
//ToolbarsPos=0,0,0
//ForceAllToolbarsOn=TRUE
//HelmToolbarOffset=361,-346
//DiveToolbarOffset=700,-346
//SensorToolbarOffset=1039,-346

//Force all toolbars on in vertical stack to the right of the mini-map
ToolbarsPos=0,0,0
ForceAllToolbarsOn=TRUE
HelmToolbarOffset=331,-200
DiveToolbarOffset=331,-270
SensorToolbarOffset=331,-340
```

By default, the bottom block is the one that is active and forces the toolbars to appear stacked just to the right of the minimap. If you'd like to change this option to one of the other available options, then simply remove the // in front of each of the 5 code lines of your choice (DO NOT remove the // from the description text). Then, add // in front of the 5 code lines on the middle block so that you're commenting it out. Do the same thing for the other two text files, and you're done. Be aware that you'll need to do this each time the mod is updated.

## Donations

I've been asked several times if I have anything set up to receive donations for those who wish to say thank you for the mod. I don't have a donation page specifically set up for this mod, but I do have one set up for another mod I created for the 4x game Stellaris called "New Ship Clases & More". If you'd like to send a donation, follow the Paypal link below. The page will say "Donations for New Ship Classes & More", but that mod is mine also, so I'll still receive whatever you choose to send.

NOTE: Donations are always appreciated but never required. The content of the mod will never change based on donations, and work on the mod will continue whether I receive donations or not.

# Information For Mod Developers
---
## Developer Announcements
_Important & urgent information for the mod developers will appear in this section._

* **IMPORTANT: When submitting a final pull request for your latest changes to be merged into the master branch, please list all of the changes you made in the comments, as this will become the official change log for each public release.**

---
## Developer Rules & Guidelines For New Content
* **All new subs must be personally approved by CaptainX3.** The new goal of the mod is not to provide as many units as possible, but instead to provide a smaller number of high quality units.
* New subs must be unique and not similar to existing subs. We're generally not looking for multiple revisions of the same sub class. (Example: We don't need an Oscar I, we have an Oscar II that works fine)
* New subs must fall within the standard time frame of the game, 1984 to present day. We will not be including old WWII subs and such.
* When creating a new sub, you may only add the **latest** weapons and sonar that was used on that class. We will not be adding dozens of obscure weapons and sonar models that are not needed.
* When creating weapons, sonar, radar, and other components for a sub, you **must** use the official name that the system is called in its origin country. (Example: The SS-N-19 Shipwreck missile is officially named the P-700 Granit in Russia, so it should be referred to as the P-700 Granit in the files and in the game.)
* When creating new units for the game, we use Wikipedia as our first choice for stats. If Wikipedia does not have stats available for your chosen unit, then you may seek alternative sources, however they must be at least credible enough to cite to the general public. **If Wikipedia has stats on your chosen unit, you are expected to use those unless you have a disputing credible source that you believe to be more correct than Wikipedia. Do not create units with stats "pulled out of the air."**
* Avoid placing excessive comments in the mod files. Comments with the author name is fine, and notations that are needed are fine, but we don't need files full of unnecessary comments.
* Respect each other's work. If you didn't create something in the mod but you'd like to change it, talk to the original creator first if possible. It's rude to change others' work without asking.

### Want To Be A Developer?
* If you'd like to become a mod developer, please contact CaptainX3 on the pbs-mod Discord channel located here: https://discord.gg/mMvpzSV
* Being a developer requires you to be on the Discord server. This is our primary method of communication.
* We'd like to keep this mod at the highest quality, so we ask and expect that all developers contribute work that is close to or equal to the original vanilla quality of the game. Substandard work will be rejected, and repeated issues will result in you being removed as a mod developer.
