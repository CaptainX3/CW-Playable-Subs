## WELCOME TO THE NEW PLAYABLE SUBS & MORE MOD
* This Github repository is the official development center for the New Playable Subs & More mod for Cold Waters. In this repository, we have two versions of the mod - the official stable release version and the development version.

* [Click here](https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/releases) to download the latest official, stable public release of the mod. This is the release that most users need to download. It will be updated periodically to reflect the latest major changes after they have been completed and are verified working.

* The development version of the mod is what you're seeing on the main page. **The development version of the mod is a constantly changing work in progress between mutiple developers, and is not guaranteed to be completely working or bug free. For most users, we recommend that you stick to the latest official release version linked above.** If you would like to try the latest development version of the mod, you can click the green "Clone or Download" button above and choose "Download ZIP" and then install the mod normally.

* If you have a bug report, the best place to let us know about it is to [open a new Issue](https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/issues) here on Github and we'll see it and respond. You can also let us know directly in the [official CW Discord](https://discord.gg/mMvpzSV), in the **pbs_mod** channel. This Discord is also a fast way to ask for tech support for the mod as well.

## FIRST TIME INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
* STEP 1: [Click here](https://github.com/CaptainX3/CW-Playable-Subs/releases) to open the Releases page.

* STEP 2: Click on the **Source code (zip)** link to initiate the download. Save the ZIP file to your desktop or wherever you can access it easily.

* STEP 3: Double click on the ZIP file to open it. Inside you'll see a single folder called **CW-Playable-Subs** with the release date and version number. Click on this folder to open it.

* STEP 4: Now you'll see two files in the window - Readme.md and an **override** folder. You want to extract **ONLY the override folder** to your desktop or wherever you can easily access it.

* STEP 5: On your computer, navigate to the following directory: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Cold Waters\ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets**. In this directory you should see only a single folder called **default**

* STEP 6: Drag the **override** folder you just extracted into this directory, so that now you see two folders, **default** and **override**.

* STEP 7: You're done. Run the game and enjoy all of the new stuff!

## UPDATING THE MOD
* STEP 1: Follow STEPS 1 thru 4 from above.

* STEP 2: On your computer, navigate to the following directory: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Cold Waters\ColdWaters_Data\StreamingAssets**. In this directory you should see two folders, **default** and **override**.

* STEP 3: DELETE the **override** folder completely so that only the **default** folder is left. DO NOT drag your new override folder and overwrite the old one - you WILL get major bugs this way!

* STEP 4: Drag the **override** folder you extracted into this directory.

* STEP 5: You're done. Run the game and enjoy all of the new stuff!

## SUBMITTING ISSUES, BUG REPORTS, & SUGGESTIONS

* Everyone is welcome to use the Github Issues system to submit issues, bug reports, and suggestions. We have a system set up to handle and respond to these issues from our end.
* We have created a label system to tag all issues. All issues will initially be assigned a Category label, which will have a white background (except for bug reports, which will have a red background). Once the mod developers review an issue, they'll assign a Status label to it. This label indicates the current status of the issue and if any further comments are needed.
* Keep an eye on issues you submit, so you can respond to developer requests if needed. Issues that require further input but do not receive it within 7 days will be closed.

# Developer Announcements

* **IMPORTANT: When submitting a final pull request for your latest changes to be merged into the master branch, please list all of the changes you made in the comments, as this will become the official change log for each public release.**

### Rules & Guidelines For New Content
* **All new subs must be personally approved by CaptainX3.** The new goal of the mod is not to provide as many units as possible, but instead to provide a smaller number of high quality units.
* New subs must be unique and not similar to existing subs. We're generally not looking for multiple revisions of the same sub class. (Example: We don't need an Oscar I, we have an Oscar II that works fine)
* New subs must fall within the standard time frame of the game, 1984 to present day. We will not be including old WWII subs and such.
* When creating a new sub, you may only add the **latest** weapons and sonar that was used on that class. We will not be adding dozens of obscure weapons and sonar models that are not needed.
* When creating weapons, sonar, radar, and other components for a sub, you **must** use the official name that the system is called in its origin country. (Example: The SS-N-19 Shipwreck missile is officially named the P-700 Granit in Russia, so it should be referred to as the P-700 Granit in the files and in the game.)
* When creating new units for the game, we use Wikipedia as our first choice for stats. If Wikipedia does not have stats available for your chosen unit, then you may seek alternative sources, however they must be at least credible enough to cite to the general public. **If Wikipedia has stats on your chosen unit, you are expected to use those unless you have a disputing credible source that you believe to be more correct than Wikipedia. Do not create units with stats "pulled out of the air."**
* All contributors must sign their work. In vessel files, place your name in a comment line at the top of the file. In files like weapons.txt, add your name at the top of your your entry in a comment line. We need to know who made what so we can all communicate better.
* Avoid placing excessive comments in the mod files. Comments with the author name is fine, and notations that are needed are fine, but we don't need files full of unnecessary comments.
* Respect each other's work. If you didn't create something in the mod but you'd like to change it, talk to the original creator first if possible. It's rude to change others' work without asking.

### Want To Be A Developer?
* If you'd like to become a mod developer, please contact CaptainX3 on the pbs-mod Discord channel located here: https://discord.gg/mMvpzSV
* Being a developer requires you to be on the Discord server. This is our primary method of communication.
* We'd like to keep this mod at the highest quality, so we ask and expect that all developers contribute work that is close to or equal to the original vanilla quality of the game. Substandard work will be rejected, and repeated issues will result in you being removed as a mod developer.
