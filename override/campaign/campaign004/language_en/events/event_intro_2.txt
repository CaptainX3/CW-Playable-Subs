Sentence2=With a surprise attack the Red Army has invaded West Germany in an apparently retaliatory operation. A major blow to NATO defensive capabilities is the capture of Iceland, which fell overnight as Soviet forces were able to land on the island undetected and seize all major assets. NATO has now lost significant ability to protect the North Atlantic.
