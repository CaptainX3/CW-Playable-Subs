1.	(S) TACTICAL SITUATION:
SATELLITE PHOTOS SHOW THAT AN ENEMY BATTLEGROUP, ARMED TO THE TEETH WITH CRUISE MISSILES, IS PREPARING TO SAIL FROM <STARTLOCATION>. INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL MAKE A CONSERVATIVE PATROL IN THE VICINITY OF <ENDLOCATION>, PERHAPS APPROACHING NARVIK. ONE OF OUR OWN BATTLEGROUPS IS SET TO ENTER THIS AREA SHORTLY AND THIS FORCE CONSTITUTES A DIRECT THREAT. BAD WEATHER PREVENTS AIR STRIKES, AND SO YOU MUST LOCATE THIS GROUP AND SINK AS MANY SHIPS AS POSSIBLE. PREVIOUS RECON INDICATES THE FORCE WILL CONTAIN ONE OR TWO SHIPS ARMED WITH ANTI-SHIP CRUISE MISSILES. CONSIDER THESE YOUR PRIMARY TARGET . AN ENEMY ESCORT OF SURFACE COMBATANTS AND/OR ATTACK SUBMARINES SHOULD BE EXPECTED.

2.	(S) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
LOCATE AND SINK THE ENEMY CRUISE-MISSILE SHIPS

3.	(S) SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:
LOCATE AND SINK ANY ESCORTING WARSHIPS IF POSSIBLE

4.	(S) AVOID DETECTION BY ENEMY ASW PATROLS

5.	(S) WEAPONS FREE

6.	(S) EMCON - MAINTAIN RADIO SILENCE UNTIL OTHERWISE DIRECTED
