[MISSION WIN]
Very pleased to see that you dealt with those subs with determination and resolve, Commander! Remember that for every enemy vessel we take out, it means a safer transit for our troops and transports. Good work.
[MISSION FAIL]
Captain, your recent mission has been evaluated as a failure to meet mission goals. This means more lost tonnage for the convoys and the enemy getting one step closer to closing the Atlantic. We'll have to do better than this, Commander. 
[MISSION MISSED]
Sorry to hear mission goals could not be met. You can't win them all. For next time, try to plan your approach better. Always remember the balance between strengths and weaknesses.  We have the upper hand.
