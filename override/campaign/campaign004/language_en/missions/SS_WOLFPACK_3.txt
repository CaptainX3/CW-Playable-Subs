[MISSION WIN]
COMSUBLANT was very happy to hear about your recent success, Commander. The Soviets should be aware that the Atlantic is our waters and that any attempt to operate in it will be forcefully dealt with. The excellent work of you and your crew is what gets that message across! Well done.
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Further search for the enemy deemed unproductive at this time.
