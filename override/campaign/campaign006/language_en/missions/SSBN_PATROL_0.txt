[ORDERS]
1.	(S) TACTICAL SITUATION:
RECENT CHINESE PORT ACTIVITY INDICATES THAT THEIR SOLE XIA CLASS BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE IS BEING READIED TO SAIL FROM <STARTLOCATION> WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND LIKELY ATTEMPT A BREAKOUT INTO THE PACIFIC AFTER WHICH THEY WILL BE FREE TO STRIKE NORTH AMERICAN TARGETS. YOU ARE TO INTERCEPT AND DESTROY THIS SUBMARINE BEFORE IT REACHES OPEN SEA. THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED THAT THE ROGUE ELEMENT OF THE NAVY HAS BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL, SO WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY RUSSIAN UNITS TO BE ESCORTING THE XIA. HOWEVER, INTEL INDICATES THAT CHINA WILL LIKELY BE SENDING SEVERAL OF THEIR OWN SUBMARINES ALONG WITH THE XIA AS ESCORTS. 

2. (S) INTELLIGENCE WARNING
INTEL HAS UNCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT THE PRC HAS DEVELOPED AN ADVANCED NEXT-GENERATION SUBMARINE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS SUBMARINE MAY BE DEPLOYED AS PRIMARY ESCORT FOR THE XIA. EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION.
