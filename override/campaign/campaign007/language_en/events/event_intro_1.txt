Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=FOREIGN RELATIONS - New president-elect Ronald Reagan has begun his term in office with establishing a harsh tone against the Soviet Union. The former Californian governor, once a Democrat, is reputed for his anti-communist stance and active part-taking in sorting out socialist-friendlies in Hollywood in the 1950's.

Sentence2=The new US President is regarded with suspicion in the Kremlin. Sources close to the Politburo affirm that Mr. Reagan is regarded as somewhat of a "loose cannon", whose presidency risks to spur controversy and conflict instead of a continuation of the more appeasement-oriented policies of Jimmy Carter.
