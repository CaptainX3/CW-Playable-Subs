Sentence2=Concerns have been raised regarding NATO treatment of war prisoners. Disturbing reports suggest that significant numbers of officers and enlisted men have been subjected to torture, tried as war criminals or executed. The fate of thousands of unaccounted Soviet troops and non-combatants will likely not be confirmed until hostilities cease.
