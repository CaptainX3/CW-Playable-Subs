Title=<b>Pershing Missiles Deployed in West Germany</b>
Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=BONN, BRD - Deployment of the new Pershing II nuclear ballistic missiles has commenced in locations around West Germany. The introduction of this high-capacity theatre weapon into the United States' nuclear arsenal has already been the cause of considerable controversy between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, as well as within Germany itself.

Sentence2=Independent political analysts agree that the continuous escalation of the arms race, NATO's presumed technical superiority and the strong Anti-Soviet rethoric of the Reagan administration adds up to a volatile situation. Moscow's latest threat - to withdraw from the arms talks - is seen as a particularly disturbing turn of events. The question looming over Europe is how the Soviet Union reacts, should it consider diplomatic negotiations as exhausted.
