History=These are small coastal container ships, with 4 in regular service with the Soviet Navy and another 20 under civilian flag which would join the navy in wartime. Their shallow draft makes them well-suited to carry supplies, ammunition, etc. in support of amphibious operations. They would also likely be found resupplying occupied coastal areas.
