It is a second generation submarine, a development of the Uzushio Class which first incorporated the US 'Albacore' style teardrop hull with its substantial increase in underwater performance over its predecessors. The Yuhsio also incorporated further advances such as flank torpedo tubes to allow a larger bow sonar. Ten were built under the fourth defense plan in 1975 fiscal year. US Harpoon anti-ship missiles were added along with other improvements starting with the 5th boat. After 1989 it made use of the new Type 59 torpedo, which is similar in capabilities to the US Mark 48 ADCAP.
