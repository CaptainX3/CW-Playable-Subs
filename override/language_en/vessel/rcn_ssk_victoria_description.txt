History=Self Noise Rating: 118 db\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nThe Victoria class submarines, also known as the Type 2400 (due to their displacement of 2,400 tonnes), are diesel-electric fleet submarines designed in the UK in the late 1970s to supplement the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine force. After the Cancellation of Canada's nuclear powered submarine program the Royal Canadian Navy explored the option to purchase the British Upholder class submarines. The first Victoria class submarine entered service with the Royal Canadian navy in June of 2005.\nThe submarines have a single-skinned, teardrop-shaped hull constructed from NQ1 high tensile steel. The hull is fitted with elastomeric acoustic tiles to reduce the submarine's acoustic signature. The class has a reported dive depth of over 650 feet (200 m).
