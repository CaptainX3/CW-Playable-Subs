History=<b>SPECIAL NOTE: Because the game is not designed for playable surface ships, some adjustments were made to this ship's stats to make gameplay more fun and to allow longer survivability in combat. These stats are not realistic, but are required to make the ship playable. This unit is still under testing, please report any issues in the mod Discord channel, on Steam, or on Subsim.</b>\n\nThis class was originally laid down as second-generation anti-submarine escorts, pairing the very capable SQS-26 sonar with the DASH drone helicopter. Because of poor reliability, the DASH was later replaced with the SH-2F Seasprite LAMPS helicopter, providing the ship with a long-range ASW capability in addition to its ASROC battery. These ships have been refitted with the TACTASS towed array.
