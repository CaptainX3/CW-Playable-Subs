History=Self Noise Rating: 115 dB\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nThis is a one-off design intended to take advantage of the very quiet natural circulation S5G plant. This made it into one of the quietest boats until the emergence of the SSN-21 Seawolf in the mid-90's. The sonar and fire-control equipment is the same as on the Sturgeon class.
