Description=[USA] Narwhal II Class SSN
History=<b>THEORETICAL DESIGN</b>\nSelf Noise Rating: 103 db\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nThe Narwhal II is an upgrade to the original Narwhal class experimental submarine. This modernized version still features a natural circulation nuclear plant, upgraded from the original S5G specifications, giving the submarine a much higher top speed. With modern improvements such as a reinforced superstructure, an interior redesign, and advanced quieting technologies, it can now dive a bit deeper than the original, carry a larger weapons loadout, and at slow speeds can operate more quietly than the Virginia class, making it the most silent submarine in the modern US Navy.\n\nDue to its small size, the Narwhal II does not feature any type of VLS system, but it can fire anti-ship and land attack missiles from its torpedo tubes. At this time, only one of these submarines has been constructed, the USS Spearfish, and it is being tested as a rapid ultra-silent special forces delivery platform.\n\n<b>SPECIAL NOTE: This class does not actually exist in real life. It is a concept sub designed for the enjoyment of anyone who wishes to use it. It is not designed based off of any real-world specifications.</b>
