Description=[USA] Jive Turkey II Class SSN
History=<b>FANTASY DESIGN</b>\nSelf Noise Rating: 118 dB\nEscape Depth: 1200 ft\n\nConjured up from the depths of the mind of a man who never left the 80's, the Jive Turkey class nuclear attack submarine is an interesting abstraction that could never have been conceived by a sane mind. This new, upgraded version is the standard size of a Seawolf class, however it defies the laws of physics and is much more manoeuvrable, and seemingly ignoring all reality, it contains a crew of over 24,000, despite being only 115 meters long. Its top speed has been dramatically improved from the previous version, and it is equipped with a somewhat interesting array of weapons that no one in the US Navy is prepared to admit exist.\n\n<b>A special gift for Jive Turkey from CaptainX3 - April 28, 2018 - Thanks for the entertainment!</b>
