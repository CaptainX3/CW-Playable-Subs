History=<b>SPECIAL NOTE: Because the game is not designed for playable surface ships, some adjustments were made to this ship's stats to make gameplay more fun and to allow longer survivability in combat. These stats are not realistic, but are required to make the ship playable. This unit is still under testing, please report any issues in the mod Discord channel, on Steam, or on Subsim.</b>\n\nThe Kirov is the ultimate embodiment of the Soviet rocket cruiser concept. With dimensions much like those of a World War II battleship, these are among the most powerful surface combatants ever built, with two of these ships built since 1980, with a further two under construction. Their large size is made necessary by the need to accommodate a large battery of anti-ship missiles as well as an area-defence surface-to-air missile system with several close-in defenses as backup.\n\nThough fitted with advanced sonar and stand-off ASW weapons, these ships generally operate as flagships of surface warfare groups protected by dedicated ASW ships.
