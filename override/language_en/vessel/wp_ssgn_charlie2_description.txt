Description=[RUS] Charlie II Class SSGN
History=Self Noise Rating: 142 db\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nThe Charlie II's differ from the Charlie 1 primarily in adopting the SS-N-9 Siren missile in place of the short-legged SS-N-7 Starbright, which necessitated lengthening the sub. They are also fitted with a somewhat quieter tandem propeller and have the ability to fire SS-N-15 stand-off missiles from their torpedo tubes, making them more formidable opponents.
