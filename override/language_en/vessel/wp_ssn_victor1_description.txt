History=Self Noise Rating: 142 db\nEscape Depth: 600 ft\n\nThis class of sixteen boats was completed in 1968 through 1975. They are not as quiet or as capable as contemporary US boats, but they were a major improvement on the earlier November class boats. They are designed for high speed with little effort at silencing, but are fitted with electric creep motors for silent drive.
